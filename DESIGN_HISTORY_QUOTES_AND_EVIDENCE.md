## 5. Evidence-Based Design

### Lists Feature - Round 12 (March 2025)
**Research Method:**
> "**Research conducted:** Remote usability testing (31 March 2025)  
> **Participants:** 5 content designers from Defra BAU  
> **Method:** Remote usability testing with think-aloud protocol"

**Participant Quotes:**
- *"'It feels like it's really intuitive and the design feels really clean'"*
- *"'Because you have to add them one at a time and come back to this point, you never get to like see your list in the drafting stage altogether, so I could have quite easily probably duplicated them if I wasn't kind of paying attention.'"* – Participant 1

**Key Findings:**
- Moving question text before options improved logic and usability
- Users appreciated entering all options on one page
- Tool design felt clean, spacious, and intuitive after one use

### Lists Feature - Round 11 (March 2025)
**Research Method:**
> "**Research conducted:** Remote usability testing (18 March 2025)  
> **Participants:** 6 users (content designers and a proxy user from Cefas, Environment Agency, APHA, Farming, Whitehall)  
> **Method:** Remote usability testing with think-aloud protocol"

**Findings Leading to Changes:**
- Required users to add the first list option before editing the question due to a technical constraint
- Participants found this confusing and preferred to write the question first
- Users wanted to see all options together while drafting
- Users disliked being redirected away from the list when adding new options

**Action Taken:**
> "Identified need to move to a question-first approach and allow all options to be added on the same page."

**Research Method:**
> "**Research conducted:** Remote usability testing (16–19 July 2024)  
> **Participants:** 8 content designers from BAU, Ivory & Waste Exemption, and internal Defra Forms team"

**Key Findings:**
- The purpose of the page is clear – participants understand what it is, what it offers, and what they can do
- Search functionality and filters are clear and helpful
- Sorting was considered the least useful feature; keyword search was preferred by participants

**Participant Quotes:**
- *"'…this is a place where I can go in and create a form.'* – Content designer
- *"'Keyword search is more useful than sorting options.'"* [Round 5, July 2024]
- *"'I don't know why we'd need sorting unless looking for recently published.'"* [Round 5, July 2024]

### Forms Library - Rounds 3 & 4 (June/July 2024)
**Research Method:**
> "**Research conducted:** Remote usability testing (24–25 June & 1–2 July 2024)  
> **Participants:** 8 content designers across various teams  
> **Method:** Remote usability testing with think-aloud protocol"

**Key Findings:**
- Both design and interaction tested very well
- Search works very well – it meets what users need
- Organisation filter works very well, like in Whitehall

**Participant Quotes:**
- *"'I want the search to be able to give me what I want without me having to wage through all this stuff.'"* [Content designer, Round 3]
- *"'Search works very well – it meets what users need'"* [Round 4, July 2024]
- *"'I think what would be a bit weird the fact that I can't search, or I can't sort it alphabetically.'"* [Content designer, Round 3]
- *"'...you can sort like in Whitehall...it's good!'"* [Content designer, Round 4]

### Preview Panel - Round 13 (April 2025)
**Key Findings:**
- Users checked preview to validate how grouped pages appeared
- Preview supported visual confirmation of layout and guidance text
- Users relied on the preview to validate grouped layouts and field presentation

**Action:**
> "Confirmed usefulness of preview for checking section layout and flow."

### Preview Panel - Round 7 (July 2024)
**Participants:** 4 content designers (APHA, Farming, GOV.UK Forms) and 1 admin officer (RPA)

**Findings:**
- Preview helped clarify how repeatable question sets would look to users
- Repeater instructions and terminology were confusing to some participants

**Participant Quotes:**
- *"'The preview helped!'"*
- *"'The word question pops up... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 times in that whole thing, which I think is just blowing my mind.'"*

### Preview Panel - Round 6 (June 2024)
**Key Finding:**
> "Preview was seen as helpful by all participants for visualising the user-facing form."

**Action:**
> "Confirmed core value of preview panel for form validation."

### Editor Redesign - Round 2 (April 2024)
**Evidence-Based Change:**
> "Component testing showed improved usability with new guided input, preview panel, and configuration panel designs. Users responded positively to clearer visual feedback and reduced cognitive load."

**Action:**
> "Implemented enhanced component designs with progressive enhancement support."

### Editor Redesign - Round 3 (May 2024)
**Evidence-Based Finding:**
> "User journey testing confirmed improved navigation and task success rates. Some advanced interactions still caused confusion, particularly around complex form configurations."

## 6. Iterative Design

### Forms Designer - Overall Iteration Evidence
**Quote from Summary:**
> *"'Even just doing it once made it less confusing the second time.'"* — Content designer feedback from Round 2

**Iteration Evidence:**
> "Through 13 rounds of user research conducted between May 2024 and April 2025, involving over 50 participants including content designers, proxy users, and internal stakeholders across Defra departments, we identified and addressed several key areas for improvement in the Forms Designer."

### Lists Feature - Iteration Progression

**Round 8 (November 2024):**
- Tested types of list questions (Yes/No, Checkboxes, Radios, Autocomplete)
- Not all users were familiar with all types, especially autocomplete
- Users needed more guidance on when and why to use each type
- Bulk entry for checkboxes was requested
- Preview panel and option entry flow were improved

**Action:** "Added clearer guidance for list types, improved preview panel, and implemented bulk entry for options."

**Round 11 (March 2025):**
- Found that requiring users to add first option before question was confusing
- Participants preferred to write question first, then add options
- Users wanted to see all options together while drafting

**Action:** "Identified need to move to a question-first approach and allow all options to be added on the same page."

**Round 12 (March 2025):**
- Moved question text entry before selecting response options
- Allowed users to add all list options on the same page as the question
- This improved usability and efficiency, with no negative feedback reported

**Action:** "Implemented question-first approach and single-page option editing for list questions."

### Conditions/Page Conditions Feature

**Round 2 (June 2024):** Initial testing  
**Round 9 (March 2025):** Iteration based on feedback  
**Round 10 (March 2025):** Further refinement  
**Round 11 (March 2025):** Continued iteration

**Total:** 4-5 documented research rounds showing continuous iteration

### Forms Library - Iteration Progression

**Initial (March 2024):**
> "Initial design decisions focused on accessibility and usability of the forms library. Key changes included layout adjustments, status tag implementation, and sorting functionality."

**Round 1 (May 2024):**
> "Intuitive, similar to Whitehall Publishing. Clear status indicators and helpful filters. Lacks search functionality. Users expect immediate access to personal forms."

**Action:** "Initial implementation of forms library with clear status indicators. Recommendation to implement immediate visibility, search, and sort functionalities."

**Rounds 3 & 4 (June/July 2024):**
- Search functionality effective
- Sorting options understandable but not universally useful
- Advanced search and state filter require further investigation

**Action:** "Enhanced search and filter capabilities. Recommendation to evaluate and streamline sorting options."

**Round 5 (July 2024):**
- Search and filters were clear and useful
- Sorting was considered the least useful feature; keyword search was preferred

**Action:** "Recommendation to reassess sorting functionality and prioritise keyword search effectiveness."
