            Problem Statement
        </span>
    </summary>
    <div class='govuk-details__text'>
        <p class='govuk-body'>Most of Defra's forms were paper-based, making them inaccessible, costly, and inefficient.
            The existing digital tools available for building forms were unintuitive, inaccessible, and required
            significant training, limiting the pace and efficiency of digitisation efforts.</p>
        <p class='govuk-body'>This directly impacted:</p>
        <ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
            <li>User confidence</li>
            <li>Form publication speed</li>
            <li>Widespread adoption by content designers outside the core Defra Forms team</li>
        </ul>

            Scope and Aims
        </span>
    </summary>
    <div class='govuk-details__text'>
        <p class='govuk-body'>Our goal was clear: deliver a timely, cost-effective, accessible, and user-centred digital
            experience for content designers building online forms. This would streamline digitisation and enable rapid,
            accurate processing of data submitted by end users.</p>

            Initial Assessment
        </span>
    </summary>
    <div class='govuk-details__text'>
        <p class='govuk-body'>To identify immediate usability issues, we started with heuristic and accessibility
            testing of the existing service. A senior interaction designer and two senior content designers evaluated
            the product against NNGroup heuristics and accessibility guidelines.</p>
        <p class='govuk-body'>We also engaged the Defra accessibility team for an independent review, with results
            pending.</p>

    </summary>
    <div class='govuk-details__text'>
        <p class='govuk-body'>We mapped the existing Defra Forms Designer workflows extensively using detailed diagrams
            in Figma. This allowed us to pinpoint specific areas for improvement and establish baseline metrics for
            future iterations.</p>
        <p class='govuk-body'>Key findings included:</p>
        <ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
            <li>A complex, unintuitive interface</li>
            <li>Overwhelming information presentation</li>

            Roadmap Reprioritisation
        </span>
    </summary>
    <div class='govuk-details__text'>
        <p class='govuk-body'>Given significant usability barriers, we decided to reprioritise our product backlog. This
            allowed our team to focus on re-designing the Forms Designer ahead of developing new features.</p>
        <p class='govuk-body'>Key decisions included:</p>
        <ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
            <li>Conducting internal research only on features already in progress (like File Upload and Repeater
                Additions)</li>
            <li>Delaying certain feature releases to prioritise usability improvements</li>
            <li>Targeting delivery of one new feature per month, alongside UX enhancements</li>

        <ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
            <li><strong>Guided Input Component:</strong> Live, dynamic highlighting within a real-time preview panel

        </ul>

        <h3 class='govuk-heading-s'>User Journey Enhancements</h3>
        <p class='govuk-body'>We improved the user journey using progressive enhancement principles:</p>
        <ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
            <li>Established clear navigation hierarchy</li>
            <li>Created dedicated primary actions</li>

        </span>
    </summary>
    <div class='govuk-details__text'>
        <p class='govuk-body'>Our iterative redesign led to tangible improvements:</p>
        <ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
            <li>Users quickly recognised navigation elements and could intuitively interact with the interface</li>
            <li>Clearer UI reduced cognitive load, improved confidence, and increased task success rates</li>
            <li>Improved component accessibility and usability, accelerating form creation and publication</li>
        </ul>
        <p class='govuk-body'>Going forward, we plan further research to address remaining user confusion around
            advanced interactions. Continued iterative development and rigorous user testing will ensure the Forms
            Designer meets evolving user needs and accessibility standards.</p>
