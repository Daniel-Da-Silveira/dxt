- 1 x Find Team, Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI), Farming
- 1 x BaU - Whitehall

- 1 x Cefas - Whitehall
- 1 x BaU working mainly with Nature, forestry and climate change content - Whitehall

**Background and reminder:**
Some participants had previous experience in creating digital forms, some did not have experience.
All content designers within Defra will be given training support to use XGov to start with.

**Method:** Remote usability testing with think-aloud protocol

**Scenario:** Testing form overview and related features.

**Note:** We asked for high-level feedback due to time constraints and because the page had been tested in previous
rounds."

content: "**Research conducted:** Remote usability testing (30 May–3 June 2024)

**Participants:** 4 content designers from BAU and Environment Agency.
- 1 x BAU working with mainly Environment Agency - Whitehall
- 1 x Environment Agency – Fishing rod licenses
- 1 x BAU working with Trade - Whitehall
- 1 x BAU updating gov.uk/intranet - Whitehall

**Focus:** Editing form content, page creation, and overview.

**Key changes:**
1. Moved sections from 'Guidance and policies' tab to Form Overview page
2. Redesigned form actions and information presentation

**Rationale for changes:**
- Participants found it more intuitive to have all form-related information in one place
- Reduced cognitive load by eliminating the need to switch between tabs
- Improved discoverability of important form details like privacy notices and support information
- Streamlined the user journey by keeping all form management tasks in a single view
- Aligned with user expectations of having all form details accessible from the main overview page

**Form Actions Changes:**
- Changed the name of the page from 'Form home' to 'Overview'
- Followed a similar pattern used in Whitehall publisher, with actions grouped in a column layout next to form details
- Moved key form actions to form overview:
- Create draft from live
- Make form live
- Close live form
- Edit draft
- Delete draft

**Form Details Changes:**
- Moved organisation details from GOV.UK details component to main body using summary list component
- Separated draft and live forms into distinct summary lists
- Improved information hierarchy and accessibility

**Research objectives:**
- Understand our users (content designers) behaviors, motivations and needs.
- Understand the process our users follow when creating/editing a form.

**What we tested:**
- Create a new form
- Form overview
- Guidance and policies tab (including what happens next, privacy notice, support details)

In this round, additional form details such as 'What happens next', privacy notice links, and support contact details
were managed on a separate tab called 'Guidance and policies'."
