content: "## Initial implementation

This was our first attempt at form validation. We placed error messages below the form fields, but user testing showed
this wasn't ideal.

### User feedback

> \"I couldn't easily see what was wrong with my form submission. The error messages were hidden at the bottom.\"

### Key issues identified

- Error messages were hard to locate
- No visual connection between fields and errors
- Messages appeared only after submission"

Based on user feedback from Round 5, we moved the error messages above the form fields. This made them more visible and
easier to scan.

#### Changes made

1. **Moved error messages** above fields
2. Added *visual indicators* for invalid fields
3. Improved message clarity

After multiple rounds of testing, we implemented inline validation with immediate feedback.
