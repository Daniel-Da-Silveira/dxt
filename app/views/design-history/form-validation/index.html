think-aloud protocol\n\n**Scenario:** Testing form editor enhancements and error messaging. Participants were asked to
test error messages, work with guidance-only pages, test input field grouping, review input type familiarity, test
preview panel, add page headers and guidance, test reordering and saving pages, enter checkbox options, test autosave
functionality, use markdown, and participate in tree testing for guidance findability."
