proxy user (xGov, GOV.UK Forms)\n\n**Objectives:**\n- Validate the usability of the new DXT 'Form Editor' re-design\n-
Validate DXT labels and content used through the new design\n- Identify what works well and what does not work well\n-
Identify any missing functionality/information\n- Identify any additional user needs and expectations\n- Validate the

public\n\n**Scenario:** Create a form for members of the public to request a county parish holding (CPH) number for
land/buildings used for livestock.\n\n**Tasks included:**\n- Create a new form\n- Ask a single question to be answered
once (e.g. when did you buy your cattle?)\n- Ask more than one question per page, to be answered more than once

I don't. Give a set of questions a name. I think maybe just that sentence, it doesn't need to be there if the questions
are about pets. The questions that they might be pets. I think what threw me was use the subject of the questions for
the question set because also it's called a set of questions there. And then a quick a question set here. And so it's
like your brain's kind of like the word question, the word question pops up 1234 times, five times in that whole thing,
which I think is just blowing my mind. – Senior content designer, Farming"
