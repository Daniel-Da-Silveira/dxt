{#
Design History Page Template
---------------------------
This is a blank template for creating new design history pages.
It extends the main design history template and sets all the variables required by that template.

Key variables:
- featureName: The name of the feature being documented.
- latestVersionLink: URL to the latest prototype version.
- status, statusColor: Status tag and its color.
- userNeed: The user need this feature addresses.
- phase, category: Project phase and category.
- researchRounds: List of research rounds (for the summary table).
- improvements: Key improvements in the latest version.
- researchHistory: Table of research rounds, findings, and prototype links.
- researchSummaries: Detailed summaries for each research round.
Each summary can contain sections of type: content, details, images, objectives, findings, recommendations, preview.

How to use:
1. Copy this file to a new location in the design-history directory
2. Fill in all the variables below
3. Add research rounds and summaries as needed
