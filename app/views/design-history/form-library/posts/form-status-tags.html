<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">The challenge</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Users needed to know what state a form is in. Tags are used across the GOV.UK form builder and
    Whitehall Publisher to show the current status of guidance and/or forms. We made a conscious decision to try and use
    similar tags in our form builder in order to limit the need to re-learn things between products.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What we found</h2>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>We found that statuses helped users scan pages and keep track of what forms needed action</li>
    <li>Users expect that when a new form is created that it automatically inherits a 'Draft' tag</li>
    <li>Changing form status during the process of adding an internal note might fit into the content designers'
        workflow (to be tested)</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What we changed</h2>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Published versus Live</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">Our first iterations used 'Published' to denote a form that is available to the public. This is
    what Whitehall publisher uses. However, GOV.UK forms uses 'Live'. To create a level of consistency, we tested using
    'Live' and found that it matched users' mental model of what it meant.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Starting small</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">In our discussions with members of the BAU content team, we found that the general lifecycle of a
    form is as follows:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>Draft</li>
    <li>Testing</li>
    <li>2i review</li>
    <li>Publishing</li>
    <li>Withdrawing</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">In an effort to follow principle of progressive enhancement, we conducted a prioritisation
    exercise and decided that for MVP, we'd focus on the following statuses:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>Draft</li>
    <li>Live</li>
    <li>Closed</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">We decided on using the term 'Closed' because 'Withdrawing' in the content community denotes more
    than one thing. In our case, 'Closed' can only mean one thing; that a form has been closed from public access.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">When forms have more than 1 status</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">Forms can have more than one status:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>1 live form and 1 draft version of that live form</li>
    <li>1 draft form and 1 closed form</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">We were concerned about displaying more than 1 status at a time for each form in the form library.
    However, in testing, we found that users found it important to be able to see both statuses at the same time. We
    also found that users generally understood the concept of having more than one status.</p>
