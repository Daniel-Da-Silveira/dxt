This feature allows form designers to create questions that can be answered multiple times, enabling users to add
multiple items of the same type. For example, adding multiple pets with their details or multiple locations with their
grid references.

The 'Add another' feature lets members of the public answer questions more than once, for example a microchip number for

the public. In our scenario and task, Defra needs to know for each cow:

The form builder interface follows this sequence:

1. **Add and edit pages screen**
- Lists all available pages for the form
- Shows page order and structure
- Allows adding new pages or editing existing ones

2. **Question setup screen**
- Presents options for question quantity:
- '1 question' for single questions
- 'More than 1 question' for repeated questions
- Clear labeling and examples for each option

3. **Edit page interface**
- Tools for adding questions and guidance
- Question type selection
- Settings configuration:
- Labels
- Error messages
- Validation rules
- Preview functionality

4. **Sequential editing flow**
- Step-by-step progression
- Clear summaries at each stage
- Live previews
- Visual indicators for progression
- Smooth transitions between screens

5. **Final edit page view**
- Complete page structure
- All questions and settings in place
- Example: 'Edit page 2' with 'Cattle information' questions"
