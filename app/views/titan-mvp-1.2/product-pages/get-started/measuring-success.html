            <p class="govuk-body">A pre-requisite to using the Defra Form Designer and working with the Defra Forms team
                is
                to confirm how you will measure the success of the forms you create.</p>

            <h2 id="confirm-what-to-measure" class="govuk-heading-l">Confirm what you will measure</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">Examples include:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>reduction in failure demand rate (the need to contact users if the information they've provided was
                    either missing or not detailed enough)</li>
                <li>reduction of 'other touch points' (prevent or reduce the need for a user seek support from other
                    channels when filling in a form)</li>
                <li>reduction in processing times</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="govuk-body">If you're replacing an existing paper-based form with a new digital form, you must
                report
                on how you'll reduce failure demand rate.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">A member of the Defra Forms team will contact you to agree:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>the success measures that will work best for your form</li>
                <li>the monitoring period, for example, 3, 6 or 12 months</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="govuk-body">The Defra Forms team will keep a copy of the agreed success measures.</p>

            <h2 id="data-comparison" class="govuk-heading-l">Data comparison</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">You'll need to collect data before and after you make your form live.</p>

            <h2 id="before-form-live" class="govuk-heading-l">Before your form is live</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">For your chosen success measures, you must either:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>have data available</li>
                <li>start to capture data to confirm whether the introduction of a digital form has had the desired
                    outcome
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="govuk-body">You will be responsible for measuring and keeping a record of the performance of your
                form. We recommend having at least 3 months of data.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">This is an important step as we need historical data to prove the form has been
                successful
                for your specific measures.</p>

            <h2 id="after-form-live" class="govuk-heading-l">After your form is live</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">You will need to:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>capture progress and stats relating to your success measures</li>
                <li>report back to the Defra Forms team after your agreed monitoring period</li>
