            <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Situation:</strong><br>
            Round 11 (March 2025) found users confused by technical terminology. Term "operator" caused confusion in page conditions. Term "repeater" was unfamiliar to users.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Task:</strong><br>
            Use plain English terminology that users understand without technical knowledge.</p>

                <li>Round 11 identified: "Terminology: Term 'operator' caused confusion"</li>

                <li>Renamed "repeater" to "multiple responses" based on user feedback</li>
                <li>Changed from technical terms to plain English throughout</li>

            Round 11 (March 2025) found users expected to write question text before selecting options, but system required selecting options first. This caused confusion.</p>

                <li>Round 11 identified issue: Users expected question text before options</li>
                <li>Implemented change: Moved question text entry before option selection</li>
                <li>Round 12 tested improvement: "Moving question text before options improved logic and usability"</li>
                <li>Result: "No usability issues observed; setup was clear"</li>

            <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Situation:</strong><br>
            Round 11 (March 2025) found users missed the "filter by condition" feature. Participant 3 said: "Filter pages by condition didn't mean a lot… Seeing the journeys or something."</p>

                <li>Round 12 tested: "Visibility improved by moving filter to left-hand pane"</li>
