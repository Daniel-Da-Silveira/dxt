            <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Situation:</strong><br>
            Initial evaluation (March 2024) revealed significant usability issues. The team needed to decide whether to make incremental improvements or prioritise a complete redesign.</p>

            Determine which approach would deliver the most value: incremental improvements or complete redesign.</p>
