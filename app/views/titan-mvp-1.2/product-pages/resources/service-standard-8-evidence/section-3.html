            <p class="govuk-body">The team has established methods for making meaningful improvements even when time is limited, focusing on quick wins and prioritising changes that deliver the most value.</p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Example 1: Rapid Terminology Improvements</h3>

            <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Situation:</strong><br>
            Round 11 (March 2025) identified that the term "operator" was confusing users. This was a terminology issue that could be addressed quickly without major design changes.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Task:</strong><br>
            Improve terminology to use plain English while maintaining functionality, within time constraints.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Action:</strong></p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>Renamed "operator" to "Condition type" (plain English)</li>
                <li>Revealed the operator field that was previously hidden</li>
                <li>Updated all related content and labels</li>
                <li>Tested in Round 12 (March 2025) - just weeks later</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Result:</strong></p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>Round 12 testing confirmed improved understanding</li>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Example 2: Incremental Flow Improvements</h3>

            <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Situation:</strong><br>
            Round 11 found users were confused by the question creation flow requiring options before question text. A complete redesign wasn't feasible immediately, but the flow could be improved incrementally.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Task:</strong><br>
            Improve the question creation flow to match user mental models while working within technical and time constraints.</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>Changed flow to allow question text first, then options</li>
                <li>Kept all options on same page for better visibility</li>
                <li>Implemented bulk entry for faster option creation</li>
                <li>Tested in Round 12 (March 2025) - rapid turnaround</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Situation:</strong><br>
            Round 11 found that "Filter pages by condition" was hidden in a dropdown and users missed it. This was a discoverability issue that could be addressed quickly.</p>

                <li>Tested in Round 12 (March 2025)</li>
