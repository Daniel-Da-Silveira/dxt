            <h2 id="designing-a-start-page-for-your-form" class="govuk-heading-l">Designing a start page for your form
            </h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">Use a detailed guide template not a form page in Whitehall.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Form pages add attachments to the top of the page. But ideally, the paper form should
                go underneath the 'Start Now' button.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">If there's an existing form template page for a paper-based form, we recommend
                unpublishing it and redirecting it to a new detailed guide template.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Here is a example start page for a form using the detailed guide template.</p>

            <h2 id="including-a-start-page-button-on-an-existing-guidance-page" class="govuk-heading-l">Including a
                start page button on an existing guidance page</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">You can add a 'Start now' button to an existing guidance page on GOV.UK for the form
                you're working on.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Start page buttons should only appear once and be used at the start of your form.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Use Govspeak (a simplified version of Markdown) to format the button.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Consider the position of the 'Start now' button and how it might change if the content
                is amended. Get sign off of the start page early on so that it hold things up when the form is otherwise
                ready to be published.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Where appropriate, speak to other content designers who may have recently updated the
                content, to find out about upcoming amends or improvements.</p>

            <h2 id="start-page-layout" class="govuk-heading-l">Start page layout</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">We recommend using a clear structure for your form start page. Say who should use the
                form in the page summary. Here's an example from a live form.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">"Fire and rescue services in England can use this service to request a pump service or
                environmental protection equipment from the Environment Agency."</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">The form start page should also include:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>a form introduction including links to any related guidance</li>
                <li>a before you start section that lists anything users will need like a reference number or documents
                    before they start</li>
                <li>an 'Other ways to apply' section if there's a paper form</li>
                <li>a 'Get help' section where we add the support details</li>
                <li>terms and conditions section if needed</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="govuk-body">Use this template if you're sending a form by email instead of hosting on a GOV.UK
                start page.</p>

            <h2 id="what-form-guidance-should-go-on-a-govuk-page" class="govuk-heading-l">What form guidance should go
                on a GOV.UK page</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">Guidance for filling in the form should be with the form, not separate to the form. Do
                not have a separate 'how to fill in this form guide' document. It's hard for users to refer back and
                forward between tabs or documents.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Guidance to be read before completing the form must be listed in a before you start
                section. Avoid referring people out of the form.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Guidance for each section must be in that section.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Do not link to guidance that could be added to the form - for example a couple of
                sentences within a guide on GOV.UK. Instead, extract the text and add it to the form.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Do not put guidance text next to a question that is not related to the actual
                question.</p>
