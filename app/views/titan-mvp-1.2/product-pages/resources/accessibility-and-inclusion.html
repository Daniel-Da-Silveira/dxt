            <p class="govuk-body">User 1 needs all the information on one page. They'll forget what they have read if
                they need to switch between pages.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">User 2 finds all the information on one page overwhelming. They need to have separate
                pages that break up the information.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">It's tricky to cater to both users in this instance. Do what you can, with the
                information you have and the technology available.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Since 23 September 2018 all public sector websites and apps need to meet accessibility
                standards and publish an accessibility statement. Online forms also need to comply with the standards.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Stick to tried and tested methods when designing a form.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">You should also:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>write questions and guidance in plain English</li>
                <li>make things as simple as possible</li>
                <li>write clear start pages (how users will find your form on GOV.UK) or update existing pages and
                    qualifying information</li>
                <li>bookmark the Defra accessibility intranet page</li>

            <h2 id="accessibility-statement-for-forms" class="govuk-heading-l">Accessibility statement for forms</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">If you use a government form building tool like the Defra Form Designer or GOV.UK
                Forms, your form is usually covered by the tool's accessibility statement.</p>

            <h2 id="assistive-technology" class="govuk-heading-l">Assistive technology</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">Some people might use assistive technology to complete online forms. You can:</p>

                <li>learn about assistive technology</li>
                <li>research your form with disabled people and assistive technology users</li>
                <li>ask the Defra accessibility team to audit your form, you can email them at <a

            <h2 id="asking-for-personal-information" class="govuk-heading-l">Asking for personal information</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">Consider the sensitives around personal questions. 'Easy' questions might be hard for
                some people to answer. Don't assume people can complete a form independently. They may need help from:
            </p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>friends and family</li>

            <p class="govuk-body">Some people might need help getting online.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Helping people use your online form is known as providing 'assisted digital support'.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">You can provide assisted digital support:</p>

                <li>via webchat</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="govuk-body">You should give users information about assisted digital support via:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>your online service - for example on a GOV.UK start page or within your form</li>

            <p class="govuk-body">Offer a paper version of an online form if your research suggests users need it. If
                you don't have any research, you can do desk research to find articles like why people prefer to use
                paper forms.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Review the paper form for accessibility. Use the accessible form template for forms in
                Word. Check the guidance for making accessible PDFs.</p>
