                data by checking if:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>an existing Defra group form (paper or online) collects the information you need</li>
                <li>an existing form can be adapted instead of making a new form</li>

                assessment</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">If you expect more than 10,000 submissions per year, you may need to create a service
                instead. A service is subject to assessments and has a dedicated team. <a
                    href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/check-if-need-to-meet-service-standard"
                    class="govuk-link">Check if you need to meet the service standard</a>.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">You won't need an assessment if you're:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>using an assured form building tool (like the Defra Form Designer or GOV.UK Forms) to create a form,
                    and</li>
                <li>expecting to get fewer than 10,000 transactions per year</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="govuk-body">This reflects the fact that forms created using an assured form building platform have
                government standards 'built in'. See <a
                    href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-9-create-a-secure-service"
                    class="govuk-link">Service standard – secure service</a> for more information.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Even if you're using an assured form building platform, you may want to follow an
                assurance process for forms with a higher degree of reputational or financial risk. This will be a
                lighter touch process than a service assessment - for example, it might be an expert review carried out
                by a design or content professional.</p>
