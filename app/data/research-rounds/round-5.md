### Detailed Research Summary

#### Round 5 – July 2024

**Research conducted:** Remote usability testing (16–19 July 2024)
**Participants:** 8 content designers from BAU, Ivory & Waste Exemption, and internal Defra Forms team

### Key insights and recommendations by section

#### Public View - Add Pets

- **Insights:** Participants expected to add multiple pets simultaneously rather than individually.
- **Quotes:**

  - "I assumed they want all pets' names rather than inputting one by one."
  - "I guess I expected spaces for more pets."
  - "Maybe we need guidance saying 'You can add up to three pets'."

- **Recommendation:** Set clear expectations early in the user journey with explicit guidance.

#### Pet Age Input

- **Insights:** Participants highlighted missing options for pets younger than a year.
- **Quotes:** "What happens if they're less than a year old? Is there an option for months?"
- **Recommendation:** Add input options for pet ages in months.

#### Submission Labels

- **Insights:** Inconsistent labels ('Send', 'Submit').
- **Recommendation:** Follow Nielsen's usability heuristics for consistency and standards in terminology.

#### Public View - Check Your Answers & Confirmation

- **Insights:** Clearly understood but lacked essential contact and timeline information.
- **Quotes:**

  - "I wouldn't know how to chase my application up."
  - "Helpful to know how long the certificate takes."

- **Recommendation:** Include contact details and expected processing times.

#### Forms Library - Search and Sorting

- **Insights:** Search and filters clear; sorting considered least useful.
- **Quotes:**

  - "Keyword search is more useful than sorting options."
  - "I don't know why we'd need sorting unless looking for recently published."

- **Recommendation:** Reassess sorting functionality, prioritizing keyword search effectiveness.

#### Form Designer - User Journey

- **Insights:** Clear overall, confusion in some navigation paths, especially around creating pages and components.
- **Quotes:**

  - "I think this has taken me around in a circle."
  - "Question set is clear but could benefit from an example."
  - "The slide visualiser is brilliant; something similar for the whole form process would help."
  - "Submit feels final; maybe use 'Save'."

- **Recommendation:** Provide clear navigation instructions, examples, and reconsider terminology ('Submit' vs 'Save').

### Next Steps

- Continue internal content designer testing with XGov design ideas
- Further external research for Forms Library enhancements
- Begin designing and testing a Defra-specific Form Designer for improved UX and usability
