### Detailed Research Summary

#### Round 11 – March 2025

**Research conducted:** Remote usability testing (18 March 2025)
**Participants:** 6 users (content designers and a proxy user from Cefas, Environment Agency, APHA, Farming, Whitehall)

### Key insights and recommendations by section

#### General Feedback

- **Insights:** Tool design felt clean, well-spaced, and intuitive after initial exploration.
- **Quotes:**

  - "It feels like it's really intuitive... very like, methodical step by step." – Participant 4

#### Page Conditions

- **Mental Model Issues:** Users expected to write the question before setting up options.

  - "It would be really nice to... think about what's my question text then think about all of my radios at the same time." – Participant 3

- **'Add a new radio option' page:** Redirecting users caused disruption.

  - "You never get to like see your list in the drafting stage altogether... could have easily duplicated." – Participant 1

- **'Edit question' page:** Felt overloaded and confusing, especially with unclear field purpose and layout.

  - "It just feels like there's a lot of information. On one page." – Participant 4

- **Conditions Placement:** Users confused by settings only appearing after saving a question.

  - "I'm slightly confused as to why these are offered at this point and not when creating the question." – Participant 5

- **Existing vs New Condition:** Order of options led to incorrect selections.

  - "Not clear what 'existing' means if I haven’t created one yet." – Participant 4

- **Terminology:** Term "operator" caused confusion.

- **Preview and filter:** Users skipped the filter by condition and found the preview incomplete.

  - "Filter pages by condition didn't mean a lot… Seeing the journeys or something." – Participant 3

#### Repeater Questions

- **Discoverability:** Some missed the 'multiple responses' option altogether.

- **Label clarity:** 'Repeater question' unfamiliar; 'multiple responses' clearer.

  - "I think that’s done but I’m not sure." – Participant 1

- **Limit setting:** Users confused about setting a fixed number of responses.

  - "Struggled to understand how you'd decide that." – Participant 3

- **Preview helpfulness:** Helped users identify setup errors.

#### Suggestions for improvement

1. Allow question text entry before radio options
2. Keep users on the same page when adding multiple options
3. Simplify and reorganise the 'Edit question' page layout
4. Introduce page condition settings earlier in the flow
5. Reorder 'Create new' vs 'Add existing' options for conditions
6. Clarify technical terms like 'operator' and 'repeater'
7. Improve visibility and clarity of the preview and filters
8. Support bulk entry for checkbox/radio options

### Next Steps

- Redesign form builder flow to align with user mental models
- Add inline guidance and improved field labeling
- Re-evaluate preview placement and filters
- Research clearer terminology for complex interactions (e.g., repeater, operator)
- Investigate autosave feedback and multi-response logic design
