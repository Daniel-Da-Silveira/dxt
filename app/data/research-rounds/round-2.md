### Detailed Research Summary

#### Round 2 – May/June 2024

**Research conducted:** Remote usability testing (30 May–3 June 2024)
**Participants:** 4 content designers from BAU and Environment Agency

### Key insights and recommendations by section

#### Form Overview

- **Positive:** Clear, consistent with Whitehall experience
- **Insight:** No issues identified
- **Quote:** Participants would refer SMEs/Policy teams, who might consult Defra legal teams if information was unclear.

#### Add Page

- **Insight:** Confusion about the relationship between creating pages and adding questions

- **Participant Quote:** "Participants' mental model is to create/add a question to the form."

- **Recommendation:** Consider automatically creating pages as users add questions (invisible design)

- **Insight:** "Select a page type" clear but better readability needed

- **Recommendation:** Use bullet points to improve readability:

  - Start Page to start a form
  - Question Page to request information
  - Summary Page at the end of a section or form

- **Insight:** "Page title" was unclear to participants

- **Recommendation:** Add more explanatory text or examples

#### Add Component

- **Insight:** Unclear to participants
- **Recommendation:** Clarify this interaction or provide additional user training

#### Reference Number in a Specific Format

- **Positive:** Participants clearly understood the "minimum and maximum number of characters" and guidance provided.
- **Participant Quote:** "This seemed really handy to be honest." – Content Designer, Environment Agency
- **Insight:** "Short label" was unclear
- **Recommendation:** Revise content for clarity

#### Preview

- **Insight:** Clear and familiar to participants, particularly "Get help with this form" content
- **Insight:** Preview with error messages was understood clearly

#### Conditions

- **Insight:** "Conditions" label unclear without prompting

- **Recommendation:** Revise content for clarity and intuitive understanding

- **Insight:** "Add or change conditions" unclear; "select" condition clear

- **Recommendation:** Clarify instructions on adding conditions

- **Positive:** Overall logic and clarity of conditional questions were well-understood

- **Participant Quote:**

  > "If I was going to approach this in reality, say I've got this old PDF form in front of me, or I was asked to create a new form, what I would expect to be able or what I would do is first of all sketch out on paper or in Mural or Figma or whatever I would sketch out first how I would expect the pages to be and then I'd feel more comfortable using this form builder." – Content Designer, Environment Agency

### General feedback

- The prototype and XGov require overall content design review for greater consistency and clarity across labels.

### Additional insights from Steve

- **Submitted forms:** Frequent updates needed for submission email addresses initially set to personal emails.
- **Contact details:** Rarely change once established.
- **"What happens next" section:** Typically stable; placeholder text commonly used initially.
- **Data protection:** Privacy notice URLs typically remain constant, even if the title changes.

### Next Steps

- Comprehensive content review by Defra Forms content designers
- Cease further testing on XGov, move towards training and low-fidelity prototyping (Figma)
