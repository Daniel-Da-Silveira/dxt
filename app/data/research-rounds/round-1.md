### Detailed Research Summary

#### Round 1 – May 2024

**Research conducted:** Remote interviews and usability testing (15–23 May 2024)
**Participants:** 6 content designers from various Defra teams (RPA, BAU, Air Quality Control, Trade and Borders, Natural England)

### Key insights and recommendations by section

#### Forms Library

- **Positive:** Intuitive, similar to Whitehall Publishing, clear status indicators, helpful filters.
- **Negative:** Lacks search functionality; users expect immediate access to personal forms.
- **User Quote:** "I’d go straight to the form I’m working on." (Content Designer, Alpha)
- **Recommendation:** Implement immediate visibility, search, and sort functionalities.

#### Filters

- **Insight:** Clear, but lacking immediate visibility of forms and alphabetical sorting.
- **User Quote:** "I see I can sort for the newest, which might be what I want to do, or I might need to search for ones that I've worked on." (Content Designer, Trade)
- **Recommendation:** Add sorting and personal visibility functionalities.

#### Published vs Live

- **Insight:** Confusion about terminology ('Published' vs 'Live').
- **User Quote:** "Published—is the same as live?" (Content Designer, Trade)
- **Recommendation:** Standardise terminology for clarity.

#### Form Name

- **Insight:** Names often decided collaboratively; users expect flexibility.
- **User Quote:** "Ideally, it would be together based on what they want the form to do and be based on good content design principles." (Content Designer, BAU)
- **Recommendation:** Explicitly state editability of form names.

#### Form Name vs Title

- **Insight:** Confusion between form 'name' and 'title'.
- **User Quote:** "The name, I assume something unique so that I can find it again." (Content Designer, BAU)
- **Recommendation:** Clarify difference explicitly.

#### Lead Organisation

- **Insight:** Clear but requires ability to select multiple organisations.
- **User Quote:** "We're sort of operating within three areas: Defra core, APHA and DAERA. So, I'm going to pick APHA, but I might want to pick two." (Content Designer, Trade)
- **Recommendation:** Enable multi-organisation selection.

#### Team Details

- **Insight:** Often no shared team email; reliance on personal Defra emails.
- **User Quote:** "I don't know what the policy team are actually called. What business area responsible for this form? I would assume that I'm responsible for this form as I'm creating it." (Content Designer, Air Quality Control)
- **Recommendation:** Provide guidance on email use and facilitate easier updates.

#### Form Overview

- **Insight:** Clear, but uncertainty about GOV.UK publishing location.
- **User Quote:** "Does it go live straight on GOV.UK? Where is it going to sit?" (Content Designer, BAU)
- **Recommendation:** Clarify publication process and location.

#### Internal Notes and Customisation

- **Insight:** Helpful but unclear for documenting changes.
- **User Quote:** Users highlighted a need for structured documentation but did not provide a direct quote.
- **Recommendation:** Provide structured guidance for documentation.

#### Guidance and Policies

- **Insight:** Misunderstood term initially; clarified as citizen-focused.
- **User Quote:** "Right. So it's policies that will be citizen facing." (Content Designer, Trade)
- **Recommendation:** Clarify labeling to reflect content clearly.

#### Privacy Information

- **Insight:** Clear but excessively lengthy.
- **User Quote:** "The text is quite long, and I would not need to read it all the time." (Participant)
- **Recommendation:** Implement accordion format for readability.

#### What Happens Next

- **Insight:** Clear content; unclear if email is only follow-up.
- **User Quote:** "I'm not clear if the email is the only option." (Content Designer, BAU)
- **Recommendation:** Clarify next-step actions; add preview for formatted content.

#### Form Preview Link

- **Insight:** Confusion about necessity of preview link post-publication.
- **User Quote:** "Why would you still need a preview link if it's live?" (Content Designer, Trade)
- **Recommendation:** Clarify the function and necessity of preview links post-publication.

### General recommendations for improvements

- Standardise terms ("Published", "Live", "Change", "Edit").
- Immediate personal form visibility.
- Implement search and sort functionalities.
- Clarify labels and process steps.

### Next Steps

- Further usability testing beginning 30 May, covering form library, conditional fields, and validation.
- Accessibility testing scheduled for 4 June 2024.
