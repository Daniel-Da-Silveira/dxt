### Detailed Research Summary

#### Round 8 – November 2024

**Research conducted:** Remote usability testing (5–7 November 2024)
**Participants:** 5 content designers + 1 proxy user (Cefas, Environment Agency, Farming, APHA, Whitehall)

### Key insights and recommendations by section

#### Error Messages

- **Insight:** 'Prefix' wording (e.g. "Enter", "Select") was confusing.
- **Quotes:**

  - "That little red thing did throw me a little bit... it felt like it was boxing me in."
  - "It just feels a bit over-engineered."
  - "I’d feel like I needed guidance on best practice for error text."

- **Recommendation:** Set expectations for prefixes, offer flexibility, and provide clear guidance.

#### Guidance Only Pages

- **Insight:** Confusion around how guidance pages relate to questions.
- **Quotes:**

  - "It's a bit nonsensical to say how many questions if it's just guidance."
  - "Will guidance be on its own page?"

- **Recommendation:** Revisit terminology and provide upfront context.

#### Input Field Grouping (e.g. names, email, phone)

- **Insight:** Common formats led to suggestion to group as 'Written answer'.
- **Quotes:** "Name, email, and phone could be bundled under short written answer."
- **Recommendation:** Explore grouping options in future design work.

#### Input Type Familiarity

- **Insight:** Users understood supporting evidence, radios, checkboxes; autocomplete less familiar.
- **Quotes:** "I’m not sure if this is a written answer or a long list."
- **Recommendation:** Provide clearer guidance for autocomplete and input types.

#### Preview Panel

- **Insight:** Helpful overall, but caused confusion for radios (e.g. expected 3 options, saw 2).
- **Quotes:** "It wasn't clear which part of the screen I should work in."
- **Recommendation:** Remove unnecessary preview items; review layout for clarity.

#### Adding Page Headers and Guidance

- **Insight:** Not always clear without upfront explanation.
- **Recommendation:** Supplement with contextual guidance in Defra Forms documentation.

#### Reordering and Saving Pages

- **Insight:** Clear to users, but returning to editor page after 'Save changes' was preferred.
- **Recommendation:** Consider automatic navigation after saving.

#### Checkbox Options Entry

- **Insight:** Annoying to enter options one by one.
- **Quotes:** "Why can’t I enter them comma-separated?"
- **Recommendation:** Explore better bulk entry options.

#### Autosave Uncertainty

- **Insight:** Users weren’t confident that progress was being saved.
- **Quotes:** "I’m a bit concerned whether that’s going to save or not."
- **Recommendation:** Consider explicit save feedback (e.g. 'Save and continue').

#### Markdown

- **Insight:** Markdown help link often missed.
- **Recommendation:** Improve visibility of markdown guidance.

### Tree Testing – Findability of Defra Forms Guidance

- **Insight:** Some terms didn’t match users’ mental models.
- **Recommendation:** Card sort and diary study planned to improve IA

### Next Steps

- Conduct card sort (via Mural and Optimal Workshop) to refine guidance IA
- Launch diary study with 15 users to explore behaviour over time
- Revisit confusing labels and interactions (e.g. preview, autosave, error messaging)
- Improve markdown visibility and flexibility of guidance entry
- Continue iterating based on user expectations and feedback
