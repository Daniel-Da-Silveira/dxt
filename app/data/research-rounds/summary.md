## Defra Forms Private Beta – Summary of User Research Rounds 1–13

### Overview

This document summarises insights across 13 rounds of user research conducted between May 2024 and April 2025 for the Defra Forms Builder Tool (DxT). Each round contributed to the iterative design of form creation, editing, conditional logic, section structuring, and data upload/download functionality. The research involved over 50 participants including content designers, proxy users, and internal stakeholders across Defra departments.

### Themes and Trends Across Rounds

#### 1. **Form Creation Flow**

- Users prefer a linear, intuitive flow from form name to question creation.
- Adding questions and options on the same page improved usability.
- Clear call-to-actions and minimal repetition were essential for confidence.

**Quote:** "Even just doing it once made it less confusing the second time." — Round 2

#### 2. **Page Conditions (Routing)**

- Most rounds touched on conditions; improvements included changing terminology from "operator" to "condition type," making links more discoverable, and providing success messages.
- Confusion arose when users had to apply conditions separately from where they created them.

**Quote:** "You think you're putting conditions on that question... but they’re actually separate." — Round 13

#### 3. **Repeater / Multiple Response Questions**

- Users understood the concept when labelled as "multiple responses."
- Naming and visibility needed work; previews helped confirm setups.

**Quote:** "Repeater makes sense once I’ve tried it." — Round 6

#### 4. **Form Preview and Filters**

- The preview panel and filter by condition features were generally liked, but users sometimes missed them.
- Positioning these tools more prominently improved discoverability.

**Quote:** "You can filter pages by condition. OK, I can see that would be useful." — Round 12

#### 5. **Field Labels and Terminology**

- Several fields like "short description," "hint text," and "operator" caused confusion.
- Clear, plain-English alternatives and examples were requested.

**Quote:** "I don't know what the difference between hint text and short description is." — Round 12

#### 6. **Page Sections and Structure**

- Section vs page hierarchy was confusing, especially when headers didn’t visually match H1/H2 expectations.
- Visual cues like H1/H2 labels were suggested.

**Quote:** "I expected the section to appear above the page header." — Round 13

#### 7. **Upload / Download Features**

- Uploading files worked well with clear guidance.
- Downloading forms via the Tools menu was successfully completed, especially for sharing drafts.

**Quote:** "The downloads thing is obviously really handy." — Round 13

#### 8. **Error Messages**

- Participants liked being able to write their own error messages.
- There was uncertainty about prefix guidance and what messages were shown to users.

**Quote:** "I’d feel like I needed guidance on best practice for error text." — Round 8

#### 9. **Visual Design and Navigation**

- Positive feedback on GOV.UK style familiarity, white space, and simple navigation.
- Success banners and autosave feedback were especially helpful.

**Quote:** "Whatever appears in a green box, I just do it." — Round 13

#### 10. **Guidance and Learning Tools**

- Markdown support, documentation links, and contextual tips needed better visibility.
- Users often wanted inline help or examples rather than external guides.

**Quote:** "Whitehall does this really well... I sometimes need a markdown reminder." — Round 6
