### Detailed Research Summary

#### Round 12 – March 2025

**Research conducted:** Remote usability testing (31 March 2025)
**Participants:** 5 content designers from Defra BAU

### Key insights and recommendations by section

#### General Feedback

- **Insight:** Tool design felt clean, spacious, and intuitive after one use.
- **Quote:** "It feels like it's really intuitive and the design feels really clean, really like a lot of space, very like, methodical kind of step by step." – Participant 4

#### Add a Question Flow

- **Insight:** Moving question text before options improved logic and usability.
- **Result:** No usability issues observed; setup was clear.

#### Add List Items (Radio Options)

- **Insight:** Users appreciated entering all options on one page.
- **Quote:** "Because you have to add them one at a time and come back to this point, you never get to like see your list in the drafting stage altogether." – Participant 1

#### Hint Text vs Short Description

- **Insight:** Participants confused about the purpose and difference between hint text and short description.
- **Quotes:**

  - "I don't know what the difference between hint text and short description is." – Participant 3
  - "The short description. That's the bit that I was like, what do I need to put in there?" – Participant 1

- **Recommendation:** Provide clearer guidance or examples to distinguish between the two fields.

#### Page Conditions

- **Insight:** Participants navigated condition setup successfully; renaming "operator" to "Condition type" improved comprehension.
- **Quotes:**

  - "Pretty straightforward." – Participant 1
  - "Easy peasy." – Participant 2

#### Existing vs New Condition

- **Insight:** Improved understanding, though some ambiguity remains.

#### Filter by Condition (Preview)

- **Insight:** Visibility improved by moving filter to left-hand pane.
- **Quotes:**

  - "You can filter pages by condition. OK, I can see that would be useful." – Participant 1
  - "Useful to check the length of the form and that all the conditions have been set correctly." – Participant 2

### Recommendations

1. Retain improved order of question-before-options in question creation
2. Maintain single-page radio option entry for better drafting visibility
3. Provide clearer definitions/examples for hint text and short descriptions
4. Continue exposing condition filters in overview pane
5. Explore clearer distinction between new and existing conditions

### Next Steps

- Draft content guidance to help users distinguish between hint and short description
- Test any further updates to page condition UI in next iteration
- Monitor user comprehension of condition logic over longer form scenarios
