### Key insights and recommendations by section

#### General Feedback

- **Insights:** Users generally found the redesign intuitive and straightforward.
- **Quotes:** "I feel quite unstressed about that! It looks pretty good!"

#### Creating a New Form

- **Insights:** 'Shared email' hint text helpful but needs revision.
- **Quotes:** "It says not to use a personal e-mail address, which is useful."
- **Recommendation:** Clarify hint text for shared emails.

#### Single Question Creation

- **Insights:** 'Get started' button confused some users.
- **Quotes:**

  - "'Get started' is like when you start a new service on gov.uk, I want 'Edit your form'."

- **Recommendation:** Consider CTA clarity and user expectations.

#### Question Frequency

- **Insights:** Users found 'How many times...' initially confusing.
- **Quotes:** "Does that mean multiple-choice, or can users change their answers later?"
- **Recommendation:** Provide clearer context or examples, such as 'Add another child'.

#### Short Label

- **Insights:** Term 'short label' unclear without reading hint text.
- **Quotes:** "I'd call it 'add text for error messages'."
- **Recommendation:** Clarify label or directly indicate error message purpose.

#### Saving Changes

- **Insights:** Users unclear if saving was necessary before adding another question.
- **Quotes:** "I don't know if I should save it first, but I'll save it to be careful."
- **Recommendation:** Clearer guidance on the need to save progress.

#### Editor Summary

- **Insights:** Very clear, intuitive, and helpful for reviewing form structure.
- **Quotes:** "It's easy to see and edit your questions, really useful."

#### Adding Multiple Questions

- **Insights:** The option 'More than 1 question' clearer after initial use.
- **Recommendation:** Maintain existing design; initial guidance needed for first-time users.

#### Guidance and Markdown

- **Insights:** Markdown helpful but requires reminders.
- **Quotes:** "I sometimes need a reminder for markdown. Whitehall does this really well."
- **Recommendation:** Provide easy-access markdown help links or tooltips.

#### Navigation After Adding a Question

- **Insights:** Unclear next steps after adding the first question.
- **Quotes:** "Should I 'Save changes'? Do I click 'Add another question'?"
- **Recommendation:** Provide clear continuation prompts at bottom of page.

#### Confirmation Page

- **Insights:** Page visually crowded and overwhelming.
- **Quotes:** "Feels like a lot going on, visually busy."
- **Recommendation:** Revisit page layout for visual clarity and navigation consistency.

#### Repeater Feature

- **Insights:** Initial confusion but understood after interaction.
- **Quotes:** "Repeater makes sense once I've tried it; initially confusing."
- **Recommendation:** Research further to validate naming of this feature.

#### Rearranging Pages

- **Insights:** Works well but lacks visual cues for easier recognition.
- **Quotes:** "Missing visual cues; can reordering be on summary page to avoid extra click?"
- **Recommendation:** Integrate reordering into main summary view, enhancing visual recognition.

### Next Steps

- Revise instructional texts for shared email and short labels
- Clarify CTA terminology and user navigation paths
- Provide markdown support and clearer form-building guidance
- Evaluate visual and interaction designs for confirmation and reordering pages
- Continue validating terminology, especially for repeatable elements
