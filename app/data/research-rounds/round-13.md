### Detailed Research Summary

#### Round 13 – April 2025

**Research conducted:** Remote usability testing (29 April 2025)
**Participants:** Multiple Defra content designers and form creators

### Key insights and recommendations by section

#### General Feedback

- **Insight:** Overall design intuitive and easy to use.
- **Quotes:**

  - "Nice big buttons... made it easy to confidently add page conditions."
  - "The system has a nice GDS feel."

#### Page Conditions

- **Creating conditions:** Participants found the journey too repetitive—especially being asked twice to select new/existing conditions.

  - "It’s a bit clunky compared to other experiences like MS Forms." – Participant 4

- **Link from questions to condition setup:** Users expected conditions to be tied directly to the question, not managed elsewhere.

  - "You think you're putting conditions on that question... but they’re actually separate." – Participant 1

- **Success message after condition creation:** Helped guide users to apply the condition.

  - "Whatever appears in a green box, I just do it." – Participant 1

- **Confirmation of condition usage:** Info about where conditions are applied felt too subtle. Clearer summary-style messaging was preferred.

- **Combining multiple conditions:** Worked well. Checkboxes and "join" button enabled confident logic building.

  - "The ability to combine conditions—that's pretty wicked." – Participant 1

#### Page Sections

- **Insight:** Distinction between "section" and "page" was unclear to many.
- **Issues:**

  - Expected section headers to appear above page H1s.
  - Hierarchy didn’t match users’ mental models.
  - Concerns about SEO and accessibility from repeated H1/H2 usage.
  - Suggested labels like H1/H2 to improve clarity.

#### Form Upload / Download

- **Insight:** Functionality tested well.

  - Users successfully found the download option through the "Tools" menu.
  - "The downloads thing is obviously really handy." – Participant 1

### Recommendations

1. Reduce repetition in the new/existing condition selection flow
2. Make condition–question relationships clearer in UI and terminology
3. Retain success banner with clear CTAs after condition creation
4. Present applied-condition info more prominently
5. Clarify section vs page hierarchy with labels (e.g. H1/H2)
6. Reassess visual layout to reinforce structural expectations
7. Maintain easy-to-locate form export/download tools

### Next Steps

- Revise UI flow to reduce cognitive load in condition creation
- Test alternative visual hierarchies for page sections
- Confirm SEO/accessibility implications of repeated heading use
- Document clearer design conventions for nested structure
- Continue testing form export/import usability across roles
